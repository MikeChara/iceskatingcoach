        Age is not a factor; I've taught pupils of all ages! All that matters is
        a desire to improve and a joy of being on the ice. Each pupil has a
        bespoke learning program to achieve goals of personal interest:{" "}
        <br></br>
        <br></br>Some follow certifications, moving up defined industry levels.
        Others care only for the adrenaline of perfectly executed jumps. Some
        simply enjoy guidance on elegant movement and the satisfaction of fine
        balance. And I have pupils purely interested in off-ice training in
        public spaces or on Zoom, focusing on stretching and health.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>We will focus on your preferences and at your own pace. Lessons
        are on a one-to-one basis, so there is no jostling for my time.
