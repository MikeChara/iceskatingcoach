        Hello and welcome! I'm an iceskating veteran coach of seven years now,
        and find great joy in the success of my pupils. <br />
        <br />
        Before coaching, I was often found doing professional ice shows across
        Europe and within the UK. <br />
        <br />
        I'm active in skating competitions around the world, and have been for
        many years. I particularly enjoy the choreographing. My most recent
        competitions were in Oberstdorf, where over the last two years I've come
        first and second in both the Women's Masters Elite Artistic, and Elite
        Free Skating categories. <br />
        <br />
        The joy of competing myself is only matched by seeing the success of my
        pupils in their own competitions!
