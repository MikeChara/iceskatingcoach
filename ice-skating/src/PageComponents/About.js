      <p>Hello! I'm Chantelle, an ice skating coach. Pleased to meet you.</p>
      <p>
        Before coaching, you could find me at professional ice shows and
        competitions across Europe. I'm still active in those arenas, but I've
        since found a new way to enjoy the ice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been coaching and taking on students for several years now, and can
        say the joy of competing myself is only matched by seeing the success of
        those I teach. Let me join you, on your journey!
      </p>
