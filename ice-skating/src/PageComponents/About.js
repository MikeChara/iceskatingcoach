        Hello, I’m Chantelle — a seasoned performer and passionate ice skating
        coach.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been on the ice for most of my life, many of them at professional
        ice shows and competitions both here in the UK and across Europe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only thing that rivals the thrill of competing and performing?
        Seeing the success and growth of those I teach.
