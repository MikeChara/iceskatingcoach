        A bit about me I'm an iceskating coach I've been teaching for the last 7
        years.Before that I did two ice shows one abroad and one in london both
        professional paid shows.I've competed myself over the years in a number
        of skating competitions.Achieving 2nd in the British Solo Ice Dance
        Championships,And 3rd another 2 times.I've also competed in Free skating
        in a number of competitions.The most recent was Obersdorf 2022 were I
        came first in both the Free Skating event and the Artistic.In Gold and
        Masters.I've had a couple of pupils over the years competiting in a
        number of the club competitions and done well.I love making up
        choreography and making up new routines.I start with teaching the basics
        first not rushing the learning process, as I think the fundamentals make
        you into a better skater.I am also a firm believer that the effort you
        put in, is what your going to get out of your journey in the sport. If
        theres not a lot of practice you'll only go so far in it.At least three
        times a week should be used for practice .And at least two or three
        lessons a week to see significant improvement.
